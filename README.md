### A simple CLI application to show the transaction flow and it's effects on a SQL database.

The application works by showing a list of available products for purchase and their price.  The user will select an id of the desired product.

The application will then ask for a specific quantity of the desired product at wich point the application will return a message saying the order is being fullfilled along with the selected product and the total to be paid.

Finally we can see how the data base is being updated after the order is fullfiled.
